### Quarter 2 Project Brainstorming

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting think about this quarter is seeing that we are able to increase robustness on missing tabulular data using ZORRO.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to continue investigating with the topic of missing data or anything else that is related to data accuracy.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
For my Quarter 1 project, I perhaps would have streamlined our code repository before turning it in.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
In my project, I would be interested in exploring techniques on different types of datasets? Not on images as it is way to difficult to do it on image data.
